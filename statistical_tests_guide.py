def guide_to_statistical_test():
    """
    Guides a user through a series of questions to help them choose an
    appropriate statistical test for their research.

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    *   Assumptions are Key: Always check the assumptions of the chosen test.
        Violating assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions.
    *   Sample Size: Some tests are better suited for small or large sample sizes.
        This guide provides some hints, but it's a critical consideration.
    *   Post-Hoc Tests: If an ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test is significant for 3+ groups,
        you'll need post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's, Dunn's) to see *which* specific
        groups differ. These aren't listed as separate primary tests but are crucial follow-ups.
    *   Multiple Comparisons: If you perform many tests, the chance of a false positive
        (Type I error) increases. Consider adjustments like Bonferroni correction or
        False Discovery Rate (FDR) control.
    *   This is a Guide: Complex research designs might require more nuanced choices
        or combinations of tests. When in doubt, consult a statistician.
    *   Effect Size: Significance (p-value) doesn't tell you the magnitude or
        practical importance of an effect. Always report and interpret effect sizes.
    *   Data Exploration: Before testing, always explore your data visually
        (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots) and with descriptive statistics.
    *   (P) indicates a Parametric test, (NP) indicates a Non-Parametric test in test names where relevant.
